# VolGAN-replica

This code accompanies our paper for Derivative Hedging Strategies. Within the code, we try to experiment with different hedging strategies. We compare the 4 traditional strategies with a Conditional GAN trained to generate implied volatility surfaces:
1. Naive Hedge
1. Delta Hedge
1. Delta-Gamma Hedge
1. Delta-Vega Hedge
1. VolGAN Hedge

The notebooks for each of these can be found in `Final Notebooks`

`Archive` contains all previous iterations of our simulations.
